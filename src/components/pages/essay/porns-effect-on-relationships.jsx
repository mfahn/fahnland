                <p>You probably clicked on this link out of a devious curiosity, so I am sorry to disappoint. The nature of this article is entirely more serious. Having been raised in a fairly religious household, I was told that pornography was evil and that, contrary to my basic human desires, must refrain from partaking in it. This led to internal dissonance as I was caught between my religious upbringing and the powerful desires that pornography so easily instigates. In this struggle, I decided to begin my own research and figure out if there is more to the story than unlimited pleasure or strict abstinence. I have made an incredible number of discoveries that sparked me to begin compiling all the research I found and create a medium with which to share this knowledge with others. I had intended to analyze relationships through the lens of internet pornography as my senior thesis for my Honors designation, however I was advised that I did not have enough time to finish it. Despite this, I chose to see it through outside of school. I have concluded that pornography, through its physical, social, and mental harms, really is the toxic poison for true, meaningful relationships, to say nothing of its spiritual harms. Make no mistake, however, that this analysis includes no religious or other biases as I have taken great care to only focus on published research. The fruition of this website is something I am quite proud of since this whole project has been over five years in the making.</p>
