        <p class="text-base text-dark dark:text-bg-gray">
            Let's assume you read my other article about porn's harms and want more information about it and how you might begin the process of undoing the neuorlogical damage that it causes. This page will detail resources to find out more information about the porn industry, its effects on those involved both behind and in front of the screen. The best word I can use to describe the porn industry, which unquestionably represents the worts parts of the internet, is sobering.

        <p class="text-base text-dark dark:text-bg-gray">
            A psychologist by the name of Gary Wilson wrote a book on the neurological effects porn has on the human brain called 'Your Brain on Porn' where he details the relevant literature. If you are interested in just the studies, his website <Link class='text-lowTeal hover:text-midTeal text-lg dark:hover:text-midTeal' to='https://www.yourbrainonporn.com/'>Your Brain on Porn</Link> has plenty of reading. Full disclosure: I have not read his book, but the research he has compiled is quite compelling. If you want an simpler website to interface with specific studies with a short synopsis about each and the ability to search for scientific literature by topic, check out this website <Link class='text-lowTeal hover:text-midTeal text-lg dark:hover:text-midTeal' to='https://truthaboutporn.org/'>Truth About Porn</Link>. It is run by a non-profit called <Link class='text-lowTeal hover:text-midTeal text-lg dark:hover:text-midTeal' to='https://fightthenewdrug.org/'>Fight The New Drug</Link> which is dedicated to sharing research about the harms of pornography on the brain, heart, and mind.

            Magic Lantern Productions, a channel on Youtube, made a three-part documentary on the underreported harms of the pornography industry on porn actors. The first video, called <Link class=" text-lowTeal hover:text-midTeal text-lg dark:hover:text-midTeal" to='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVr0jfVt7F0'>Beyond Fantasy: Barely Legal</Link>, focuses on the recent trend in porn that depicts women as underrage. <Link class="text-lowTeal hover:text-midTeal text-lg dark:hover:text-midTeal" to='https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/opinion/sunday/pornhub-rape-trafficking.html'>A New York Times investigation</Link> by Nicholas Kristof, showed Pornhub, a prominant porn tube site, failed to properly vet videos uploaded to the site for child pornography, and such content was easily available to anyone. In the wake of this investigation, major credit card companies dropped service for the site, and it was forced to remove millions of videos from the platform. It should be noted that this documentary series does depict some disturbing content to prove the claims of the actors, and while it is blurred out, it is still not safe for work. I think it is important to humanize the actors that porn denigrates and depicts in a one-dimensional manner to understand the harms that participating in the industry supports.

            The second video shares the experiences of actors with disease in the industry, how porn companies take safety shortcuts to ensure profits such as lax and ineffective STD testing which endangers actors and actresses.<Link class=" text-lowTeal hover:text-midTeal text-lg dark:hover:text-midTeal" to='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqcHIMOI204'>Beyond Fantasy: Unsafe Sex</Link>

            The third video, called <Link class=" text-lowTeal hover:text-midTeal text-lg dark:hover:text-midTeal" to='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVr0jfVt7F0'>Beyond Fantasy: Hardcore</Link>, exposes the porn industry's manipulation of women to get them to film dangerous, violent, and often illegal scenes against their will, including rape.

        <h1 class="text-lg text-darkdark:text-bg-gray font-bold text-center">Resources for Stopping</h1>
        <p class="text-base text-dark dark:text-bg-gray">
            Different people might have different theories on how to quit this habit; some people might want to understand their relapses in detail, such as the days that they are most likely to relapse, the places, emotions, and events that contribute to relapses, etc. The Fortify app on mobile app stores is a valuable resource for tracking victories and setbacks in this journey where you report those metrics each day. They also have several video series to understand the theory behind things you can do to grow out of harmful habits like porn. I have used this app for many years (which is why I know the exact date I started tracking my progress). Recently, however, I have stopped tracking with the app because it requires porn to always be on my mind since the user must track whether each day was a victory or a setback. I view not watching porn as a lifestyle instead of a destination to achieve, which tracking days makes it into. I don't want to discourage you from using this app, however, and every major sports team uses in-depth metrics to track athletic performance, so you will need to figure out for yourself how you want to approach this.

            I found the <Link class=" text-lowTeal hover:text-midTeal text-lg dark:hover:text-midTeal" to='https://exodus90.com/'>Exodus 90</Link> program to be crucial in developing a stronger faith, building fraternity, growing self-control, and appreciating good things in moderation. It is a 90-day program beginning in January and ending on Easter Sunday where participants abstain from things that modern men typically rely on for happiness such as social media, games, sweets, snacking, alcohol, warm showers, and other creature comforts. You will be paired up with one other man as an accountability partner that you will check-in with each day to talk about the daily Bible readings and reflections. Exodus 90 fraternities usually have three or four pairs of men who meet once a week and partake in regular team-building activities. The Bible readings follow the journey of the Isrealites out of slavery to the Egyptians, a fitting parallel to the modern man spurning reliance on or addiction to material goods and reodering the self towards God and an appreciation of His gifts. It is built for Catholics and certain parts cater to the Catholic faith, but any Christian would certainly get value out of it and would be able to participate in almost every part of it. There is a similar program for women called <Link class=" text-lowTeal hover:text-midTeal text-lg dark:hover:text-midTeal" to='https://www.mag90.com/'>Magnify90</Link>.

            Covenant Eyes is also a valuable application with both Android and Apple versions that protects a user from porn and provides an accountability framework. The app works by routing all traffic on a device through a custom VPN that filters pornographic websites and enforces Safe Search settings on Google. The application also has a screen monitor that flags adult content on a screen using machine learning algorithms so apps other than browsers are monitored. Trusted relatives or friends can receive notifications if such material is detected so that they can help break the cycle and intervene. Google, Apple, and Windows all have built-in safe search features to limit access to this material as well. While you cannot do this with Covenant Eyes enabled, you can change your DNS servers on your home network and devices to OpenDNS or Quad9 which will not respond to inappropriate DNS requests. You should do that anyway since Quad9 DNS servers will block requests to known malicious websites.
