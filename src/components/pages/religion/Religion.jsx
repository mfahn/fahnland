        In my opinion, science and religion are seen as contrary, or mutually exclusive beliefs, and I feel as though Christians are seen as . However, in the natural world, there are a significant number of phenomena that cannot be explained by the scientific enterprise and can only be understood through the lense of religion. It is this intersection that I want to explore in this article. Below are several websites that various people have created over the years that discuss miracles, in the scientific and religious sense of the word. Many of them have to do with the Eucharist, or Body of Christ, changing its appearance from bread to actual heart tissue. The Eucharist always begins as unleavened bread, or bread that does not contain yeast. This is a reference to God's command to the Isrealites during their exodus from the slavery of the Egyptians in the Book of Exodus. Through the blessing of a priest, the same one that Jesus used at the Last Supper, and the merits of the blessing of priesthood conferred upon him from a bishop, it changes into the actual Body of Christ. It retains its appearance of bread and wine, although as one sees from the below websites, that is not the only form it may take.

            This website details some of the miracles directly related to the existence of Jesus Christ such as the Shroud of Turin, the Veil of Manoppello, and the Veil of Veronica. It also details a miracle regarding the Holy Eucharist turning into heart tissue with a distinct AB blood type. This heart tissue can still be observed in a church in Luciano, Italy where it has remained incorrupt without the assistance of preservers.

        <div className="text-base pt-5">
            This is the most comprehensive list of Eucharistic Miracles ever, compiled by Blessed Carlos Acutis. It details miracles from all over the world, many of which have been thoroughly investigated by doctors and medical experts. In every instance, the bread blessed by a Catholic priest has turned into heart tissue that doctors say underwent intense stress consistent with the horrific death Jesus died. The circumstances surrounding these events make the possibility that the miracle was faked completely impossible. Many of the samples of heart tissue and blood are incorrupt and can still be viewed to this day.

            This link tells the story of the life of Blessed Carlos Acutis, a 21st century web developer who battled cancer as a teenager but used his talents to serve God by bringing centuries of miracles into a globally accessible website. He has been declared Blessed by the Catholic Church, which is the last step before being declared a saint, or recognized as someone who is in heaven.

            This website contains many resources such as the Biblical backing for the Holy Eucharist, angelic apparitions, and fundemental truths of the Catholic Church. Some of these apparitions even occurred in the 20th Century with tens of thousands of eye witnesses like in the case of the Miracle of Fatima.

        This entry is a little different: instead of a website, this is a book review of the Shroud of Turin, by Dr. John Heller. In it, he details a Herculean effort by 40 distinguished scientists in the 1970's to rigorously study the Shroud of Turin using the best technology available at the time. The Shroud is the cloth in which Jesus Christ was supposedly buried after his death and is a crucial piece of evidence of His resurrection. Plenty of evidence exists that Jesus was a legitimate historical figure, particularly the writings of several Roman historians, but Christians maintain that this cloth is His burial cloth. This group of scientists from highly respected agencies such as the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, _____, _____, created tests to challenge a wide range of claims. The group independently assembled scientific equipment, organized travel for themselves and shipping for their equipment, and lodging to study this cloth over a period of a few days. They all did this in their spare time and at substantial personal cost to obtain a scientifically definitive answer about the cloth's legitimacy. Not to spoil the book, but their findings were incredible and impossible. Most of the scientists were a-religious at the time of study and their main interest was in disproving once and for all the narrative that the Shroud of Turin is the burial cloth of Jesus Christ.

            One of the reasons for the emphasis on the Shroud of Turin is that it is a physical object whose existence is inexplicable by science analysis.

            Maybe buying and reading the book for yourself is too much work, so here is a shorter synopsis of the research conducted on the Shroud in PDF form. <a href="Science-and-the-Shroud.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-lowTeal hover:text-midTeal font-bold dark:text-lowTeal dark:hover:text-teal">This</a> is the link to a study of the Shroud of Turin published in December of 2022.

            Certainly the existence of the Shroud of Turin does not directly prove that Jesus rose from the dead like the Bible claims, but one must ask how many pieces of indirect evidence must be provided before the eye witness testimony of the original Apostles is to be believed.
