        <div class="text-base mr-auto ml-auto p-5 w-4/5">
            This website details some of the miracles directly related to the existence of Jesus Christ such as the Shroud of Turin, the Veil of Manoppello, the Veil of Veronica. It also details a miracle regarding the Holy Eucharist turning into heart tissue with a distinct AB blood type. This heart tissue can still be observed in a church in Luciano, Italy where it has remained incorrupt without the assistance of preservers.

            This website contains many resources such as the Biblical backing for the Holy Eucharist, angelic apparitions, and fundemental truths of the Catholic Church. Some of these apparitions even occurred in the 20th Century with tens of thousands of eye witnesses like in the case of the Miracle of Fatima.

        <div class="text-base mr-auto ml-auto p-5 w-4/5">
            This is the most comprehensive list of Eucharistic Miracles ever, compiled by Blessed Carlos Acutis. It details miracles from all over the world, many of which have been thoroughly investigated by doctors and medical experts. In every instance, the bread blessed by a Catholic priest has turned into heart tissue, with the circumstances surrounding the event making the possible faking of the miracle completely rediculous. Many of the samples are incorrupt and can still be viewed to this day.

            This link tells the story of the life of Blessed Carlos Acutis, a 21st century web developer who battled cancer as a teenager but used his talents to serve God by bringing centuries of miracles into a globally accessible medium. He has been declared Blessed by the Catholic Church, which is the last step before being declared a saint.
